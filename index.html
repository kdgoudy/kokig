      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hello all, I'm Koki. I was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana. I'm was in the Marine Corps for 8 years and a sheriff deputy for 2 years. I decided to learn computer programming in 2017 and started focusing in Front End Development. I am proficient in HTML and CSS. I'm currently using educational platforms such as FreeCodeCamp, Team Treehouse and taking courses in Udemy. I am a recipeint of the 2018 Grow with Google Udacity Scholarship where I was able to get a better understanding of HTML and CSS, plus get a strong foundation in the basics of JavaScript. I am open to the opportunity to work with others to learn more of front end developement and expand my knowledge and skillset.</p>
